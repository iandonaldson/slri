			<p>This list expands on the previous section.  Each section beginning with a blue bar represents another 
potential interactor. Each row in the table below the blue bar represents another paper where your query protein 
co-occurs with the potential interactor.  Each potential co-occurence is rated as to its likelihood of representing a real
interaction.  In addition, the likelihood that the paper itself contains interaction information is listed; this 
likelihood is based on the svm score in the last column. Click on any one of the "GO" buttons to review that 
particular abstract.
