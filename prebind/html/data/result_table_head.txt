			<p>All of the PubMed Identifiers that were returned by PubMed searches are listed in this section regardless of whether the paper describes molecular interaction information.<br>

A yellow bar divides the results of each search into its own section. For each search result, the table lists the search name, the PubMed Identifier of the returned abstract and an "interaction" score that was generated by a Support Vector Machine trained to recognize interaction papers. Negative scores indicate papers that are not likely to contain interaction information while papers scored positively most likely do contain interaction information. Scores that are greater than zero are indicated by one or more asterisk (*) next to the PubMed Identifier.  An exclamation point next to the PubMed Identifier indicates an abstract that has an "interaction-related" word in it (see the PreBIND Help page for more details).
