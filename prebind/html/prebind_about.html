<font size=+2>About PreBIND</font>
<br>
<p><font size=+1>What is PreBIND? The short answer.</font>

<p>PreBIND is a data mining tool that helps researchers locate biomolecular
interaction information in the scientific literature. You can enter the
name or accession number of a protein and PreBIND will return a list of
potentially interacting proteins.  

<p>This list is composed from a list of papers returned 
by your query protein that contain interaction information. 
These papers are found using a list of synonyms that the protein is known
by so you can find papers that talk about the protein by names other than
the one that you entered.  

<p>The fact that a paper describes interaction
information is determined by a supervised learning algorithm called a support
vector machine (SVM); for this reason PreBIND may return papers that could
not be easily retrieved simply by doing literature searches for keywords
such as "interaction".  

<p>PreBIND was designed to find information
that can be entered (after human inspection) into the Biomolecular
Interaction Network Database (BIND).

<p>You should note that this version of PreBIND is a prototype and information
is only available for yeast, mouse and human proteins described in the RefSeq database at
the NCBI.

<p>To get started, you can read the brief instructions on using PreBIND
(click on "Help" in the menu to the left) or follow the examples
provided (click on "Search PreBIND" in the menu to the left).
