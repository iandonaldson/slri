<br>
<p>
<p>The PreBIND site was designed and written by 
Ian Donaldson.  He is currently a member of the Blueprint initiative in 
Christopher Hogue's lab at the Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute in Toronto.  

<p>The Support Vector Machine (SVM) and associated Textomy software used for analysis of 
abstract literature was written by Joel Martin and Berry deBruijn of the 
Interactive Information Group at the Institute for Information Technology
(National Research Council of Canada).  

<p>Records used to train the Support Vector Machine were supplied by 
Cheryl Wolting, Berrivan Baskin and Ian Donaldson of the Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute.

<p>Gary Bader in Dr. Chris Hogue's lab at the Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute was the lead
developer of the BIND database and its associated software.

<p>Katerina Michalickova is the lead developer of the SeqHound project.

<p>We would like to thank all members of the Hogue lab for their support of this project.

<p>We would also like to thank the National Institute for Biotechnology Information 
(NCBI) for freely providing access to the PubMed database and their NCBI Programming toolkit.
