***common to do***



-all printf's should also print to log file
-parser_log file should be written to datafiles folder where all other results go





***prebind_cgi to do***

/*THINGS TO DO:
SHORT TERM
-the cgi will run as a console app if not given an accession number parameter but produces an application error if run over the network with no accession number??
(it did not always do this). A warning is posted to the log file:
WARNING: [000.000] {taskapi.c, line 475} [GetTaskArgs] No value found for arg |accession|.
The web page successfully displays the default search results anyway but spawns a process that hangs.
-change error message for nothing found in name search
-change linking method for accession list page
-header/footer to accession link page and print as a table
-consider changing occurence sof StrCpy to StrSave
-implement name redundancy flag

-change GetAllDatabyAccorGIandPrint so that it uses GetAccRecodbyGI
-implement name redundancy flag


LONGER TERM
-feedback functions
-taxon number to name function/database
-the functions ResultFillNode and SearchFillNode may be unecessary and could be combined with (respectively) GetListofResults and GetListofSearches
as it was for GetListofPoints
-allow users to specify their opinion about a paper in general (interaction or not)
-allow users to generate complex records
*/

***prebind_searcher to do***

-do not allow searcher to proceed unless a defined taxon has been specified (use config file settings)
