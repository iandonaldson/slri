Building the C++ version of the remote SeqHound API

You will need the following libraries:

1. NCBI C++ toolkit found at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/.
2. SLRI C++ library &
3. SeqHound C++ remote library, both found at http://sourceforge.net/projects/slritools/.

Building the NCBI C++ toolkit

You will need just over 1GB of hard drive space for the NCBI C++ toolkit (on Linux/Unix platform).
Find an appropriate space for the toolkit and download the current copy of the toolkit as above.

For Unix/Linux platforms, download the 'ncbi_xxx_unix.tar.gz' file into the appropriate directory.
Unzip and un-tar the file by running the command:

gunzip -c ncbi_cxx_unix.tar.gz | tar xvf - i
Run the configure script using the command:

./configure --with-objects --without-suffix
Follow the instructions displayed after configure finishes executing. It is something of the nature,

cd /home/ncbi_cxx/GCC/build; make all_r
Building the SLRI and SeqHound libraries

You will need to download the slri and seqhound libraries. The easiest way
to do this is to go to the above address, and download the SeqHound release package.
Unzip and un-tar the file by running the command:

gunzip -c seqhound-200xxxxx.tar.gz | tar xvf -
Next, you will need to create 2 environment variables:
NCBICXX to point to the ncbi_cxx toolkit and
SLRI to point to the slri directory.

The best way to do this is to have your operating system automatically create them each time you log in.
The exact way to do this will depend on the shell you are using. Go you your home directory and run the command:

echo $SHELL
If the response is /bin/tcsh, then add the following lines to the end of the file .cshrc:
setenv NCBICXX /your/path/to/the/ncbi_cxx/directory/
setenv SLRI /your/path/to/the/slri/directory/

If the response is /bin/bash, then add the following lines to the end of the file .bashrc:
export NCBICXX=/your/path/to/the/ncbi_cxx/directory/
export SLRI=/your/path/to/the/slri/directory/

(For other shell types, consult a Unix help book).

Save the changes and then open a new console window to allow the additions to be loaded up.

In the directory slri/lib_cxx/scripts you will find two files called generate_XXX.sh.
You may need to edit the 2 files. Change the contents of the 2 files to say:
TOOLDIR=$NCBICXX/GCC/bin/datatool
D=$NCBICXX/src/objects
INTERNAL=$SLRI/lib/asn

(leave the rest of the file as is).

Now run the 2 scripts by typing the commands:
./generate_slrilibstruc.sh
./generate_slrilinkset.sh

Next, in the director slri/lib_cxx/src, you will find a file slri_cxx.mk
Make sure that BASEDIR is set as:
BASEDIR= -I$(NCBICXX)/include

In the file Makefile.slri_cxx in the same directory, make sure that:
builddir = $(NCBICXX)/GCC/build/

You can now build the slri library:
make -f Makefile.slri_cxx

In the directory slri/seqhound/asn/ are 2 files:
generate_nblastasn.sh
generate_slristruc.sh

Make sure that in both files:
TOOLDIR=$NCBICXX/GCC/bin/datatool
D=$NCBICXX/src/objects
INTERNAL=$SLRI/seqhound/asn

Then run both scripts by executing:
./generate_nblastasn.sh
./generate_slristruc.sh

In the directory slri/seqhound/src_cxx there is a file seqhoundrem_cxx.mk. Make sure that:
BASEDIR = -I$(NCBICXX)/include

In the same directory, edit the file Makefile.seqhoundrem_cxx so that:
builddir = $(NCBICXX)/GCC/build/

Then make the seqhound library by executing:
make -f Makefile.seqhoundrem_cxx

Building a test application that uses the C++ API

To build a test application that uses the C++ API:
1) edit 'Makefile.mytest' in slri/seqhound/src_cxx directory, making sure that:
builddir = $(NCBICXX)/GCC/build
CXXINDIR = -I$(NCBICXX)/include -I$(NCBICXX)/GCC/inc
INCOBJDIR = -I$(NCBICXX)/include/objects

Then create the applicaton by:
make -f Makefile.mytest
