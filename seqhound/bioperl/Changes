Revision history for Perl extension Bio::SeqHound::SeqHound.

4.0
	April 21, 2005
          
	  - Modified pod documentation in SeqHound.pm to correct the return value.
	  
	  - Modified mergeValues() and getValues() in SeqHoundTextOb.pm SeqHoundLOB.pm
	    SeqHoundGB.pm to better handle the error or null return cases.
	    
	  - Added new functions adapt to  new comgen module
	   SHoundRNAFromChromosome -retieve rna identifiers from NCBI chromosome
	                            identifier
	   SHoundRNAFromUnknownChromosome -retrieves all rna identifiers which 
	                            have not been assigned to a specific
				    chromosome
	   SHoundRNAFromOrganism   -retrieves rna from a genome
	   SHoundDNAFromUnknownChromosome -retrieve all dna identifiers which
	                            have not been assigned to a specific
				    chromosome

	    			    identifiers which have not been assigned to
				    a specific chromosome
	   [bug 4914]            

           - LWP::UserAgent replace LWP::Simple to have a better control of
	   HTTP::Request and HTTP::Response objects. 
	   
	   - Changed the return value from "0" to "undef" if SeqHound function
	   calls fail as "SeqHound_ERROR"" or "SeqHound_NULL" or no result returned.

          - SHoundGetTaxIDFromMergedTaxID -retrieve a valid taxid from a possible
	                                  merged taxid. bug [3474]

      August 31, 2004
          - Our server response time is about 90 seconds, following functions
	    might fail due to server time out, but they might succeed on
	    certain test cases: 
	    SHoundNeighboursFromTaxID 
	    SHoundGetGisByNumberOfDomains
	    SHoundGiFromGOIDList
	    SHound3DNeighboursFromTaxID fails
	    
	  - Added functions: bug [2785]
            SHoundAllGenomesWithScientificNames   -retrieves all genomes with
	                                           their scientific names in 
						   SeqHound system
	    SHoundAllGenomesWithNumProteins       -retrieves all genomes with
	                                           their number of proteins in
						   SeqHound system
						   
	  - Added missing test functions on test.pl: bug [3099] 

3.0   This is the first official release of the SeqHound Bioperl module. Note
      that this package is distributed and maintained by the Blueprint
      Initiative. It is not an official part of the Bioperl release. In future,
      functionality contained in this package could be included as part of
      Bioperl. Contact seqhound@blueprint.org for more details.
     
      July 27, 2004
	  - SHoundNeighboursFromTaxID, SHound3DNeighboursFromTaxID 
	    and SHoundGetGisByNumberOfDomains as known bugs, this might be
	    from server side not API itself.
      July 19, 2004
          - Add and update all documentation  [bug 2533]
            POD documentation for all API functions in SeqHound.pm
            Remove README_API file as no longer required
	    README.pod - README text file now generated from POD file

      July 14, 2004
	  - Disable function SHoundAllGODBGetHierarchyLevel - logic incorrect

      
      June 29, 2004
          - Major refactor to be consistant with BioPerl modules [bug 2533]:
	    removed Bio::SeqHound::_SeqHoundParser;
	    removed Bio::SeqHound::SeqHoundFasta;
	    removed Bio::SeqHound::SeqHoundASN;
	    removed Bio::SeqHound::GB2Seq;
	    removed Bio::SeqHound::SeqHoundOb;
	    added function parse_FastaHash to SeqHound.pm in order to parse Keyed 
	    list into hash table, this function is original located in 
	    Bio::SeqHound::SeqHoundFasta;
	    removed objects for Fasta, ASN, GB2Seq, replaced with Bio::Seq objects

      May 31, 2004
