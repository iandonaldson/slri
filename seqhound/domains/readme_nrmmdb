nrmmdb is list of PDB protein chains created by BLAST using E-value cutoff 10e-7
the list is subsequently filtered by several criteria using filternrset (see below); 
three chains (1CBN, 1DIN, 1CRA) were removed since they caused crashes of countsscpot 
secondary structure count potential program


the file was created on February 19, 2002  using:
1. nrfilter(/slri/mmdbnrset/nrfilter.c) on nrpdb.110701 file
2. the output from nrfilter was filtered using 
(filternrset/slri/trades/misc/filternrset.c)
the command line for filternrset.c:
filternrset nrpdb.110701.filtered filtmmdblist -l 40 -q 20 -u 0 -i 5 -m 5 -s 5 -r 3
